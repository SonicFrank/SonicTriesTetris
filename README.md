# SonicTriesTetris
Followed a Tutorial by Javier Lopez on javilop.com


Trying to make a Tetris clone following tutorial by Javier Lopez on javilop.com. Trying to learn.



**Things I am trying to do:**

-Make my copy work. Having trouble getting SDL linked/working properly in VS2022. Might try to use SDL2 as I can find a tutorial for it.
-Try to do a version with OpenGL.
-Make down arrow drop piece rather than x. 
-Add Score
-Add Levels
-Learn as much as possible.
